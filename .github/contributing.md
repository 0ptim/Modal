# Contributing

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project! In order to make this experience as smooth as possible we've created this guide to help you understand how we work. Please read it through before starting any work as we may close PRs which don't follow our guidelines.

## Proposing a change
1. Search for existing issues which may have discussed the feature or change you wish to raise.
2. If there is no existing issue, raise a new issue using the appropriate template giving as much detail as possible.
3. Once discussed, if a change is to go ahead, raise a PR for the change using the guidelines specified below.

## Pull Request Process

1. Keep your pull request focused. This means: try to only introduce changes necessary for fixing the bug or adding the feature you are working on. If you find other things you want to change like some formatting or style errors or a completely separate bug, please open a separate pull request for that (make sure to still discuss these changes in an issue).
2. When changing or adding a new feature, make sure to update the [readme.md](../README.md) to include an example of how to use the new feature or any information developers should need to know regarding the change.
4. When changing or adding a new feature, make sure to update both the [server-side](../samples/BlazorServer) and [webassembly](../samples/BlazorWebAssembly) samples.
