# Contributing

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue with the owners and/or contributors of this repository before making a change. Also use the search the existing issue to see if your idea has been discussed before.

## Pull Request Process

1. Keep your pull request focused. This means: try to only introduce changes necessary for fixing the bug or adding the feature you are working on. If you find other things you want to change like some formatting or style errors or a completely separate bug, please open a separate pull request for that (make sure to still discuss these changes in an issue).
2. When changing or adding a new feature, make sure to update the [readme.md](readme.md) to include an example of how to use the new feature.
3. When changing or adding a new feature, make sure to update the [docs/src](docs/src) with examples of the new feature.
4. When changing or adding a new feature, make sure to update both the [server-side](samples/BlazorServer) and [webassembly](samples/BlazorWebAssembly) samples.
5.
